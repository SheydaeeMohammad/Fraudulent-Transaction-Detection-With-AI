# Fraudulent Transaction Detection With AI

### Summery
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Utilizing a robust synthetic dataset generated by the PaySim simulator—which accurately replicates the dynamics of real-world mobile money transactions—our model aims to identify suspicious activity with high accuracy

### Dataset

This dataset is a synthetic financial transactions dataset generated by the PaySim simulator, designed specifically for fraud detection research. It mimics mobile money transactions and captures typical behaviors as well as fraudulent activities within a simulated financial environment.

It contains various transaction types, including payments, cash-ins, cash-outs, transfers, and debit transactions, each with relevant features such as amount, origin and destination types, and timestamps. The dataset is labeled to indicate which transactions are legitimate and which are fraudulent, enabling supervised learning approaches.

Because it is synthetic, PaySim allows researchers to experiment extensively without privacy concerns associated with real financial data while providing realistic transaction patterns.

### Methodology

By applying supervised machine learning algorithms, including classification models tailored for imbalanced datasets, the system learns to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions. Feature engineering and data preprocessing are carefully handled to maximize detection effectiveness.

### Goals and Impact

The ultimate goal is to provide financial institutions and mobile payment platforms with a scalable, efficient fraud detection tool that reduces monetary losses and enhances user trust. This project also serves as a foundation for further research and development in the field of transactional security.
